  description: >
    Experienced bilingual professional (Portuguese and English) with a BSc in Computer Science and over 8 years of experience in software development, full-stack, DevOps, SQL database management, and client support for multinational companies such as Wood Group, Johnson & Johnson, ChampionX, Nalco, Itaú, PayPal, LATAM, Certisign, and ONS.  
    I am currently pursuing an MSc in Software Design with Cloud Native Computing at the Technological University of the Shannon (TUS), Ireland, focused on modern cloud-native architectures, DevOps practices, and scalable software systems.
    I have strong skills in C#, Python, front-end frameworks (Angular, Vue, React), TypeScript, SQL, and I am familiar with cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure. I have also worked with MongoDB, SQL Server, MySQL, and have experience in unit and API testing, software architecture, and team-based engineering projects.  
    Passionate about continuous learning, I enjoy tackling challenges, improving systems, and delivering solutions that enhance user experience and performance.
